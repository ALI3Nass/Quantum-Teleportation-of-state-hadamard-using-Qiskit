# Quantum-Teleportation-of-state-(|0>+|1>)/âˆš2-using-Qiskit

This repository contains an example of a quantum circuit with measurements using Qiskit, a Python framework for working with quantum circuits and simulating quantum systems. The code snippet provided demonstrates how to construct a quantum circuit that perform Teleportation on the qubits.

## Installation

To run the code in this repository, make sure you have Qiskit installed. You can install Qiskit using the following command:

pip install qiskit

## Usage

The code snippet provided can be run in a Jupyter Notebook or any Python environment. The code constructs a quantum circuit with 3 qubits and 3 classical bits. Here's a breakdown of the code:

- **Creating a Quantum Circuit**: Demonstrates how to create a quantum circuit with 3 qubits and 3 classical bits using Qiskit and visualize it.
- **Applying Quantum Gates**: Applies quantum gates, such as the X gate and Hadamard gate, to the qubits in the circuit.
- **Adding Barriers**: Inserts barriers in the circuit to separate different stages of the computation.
- **Measuring Qubits**: Measures qubits in the circuit and assigns the measurement results to classical bits.
- **Simulating with QASM Simulator**: Simulates the quantum circuit using the QASM simulator backend and obtains the measurement counts.
- **Plotting Histogram**: Visualizes the measurement counts as a histogram.

Feel free to explore and modify the code snippet to experiment with quantum computing concepts using Qiskit.
